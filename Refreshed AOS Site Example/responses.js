// # GUIDE: You can add custom responses by copying and pasting everything from (and including)            #
// # a "{" to the next "}" on the line right after the last "}". Type a "," on the SECOND TO LAST "}"      #
// # (The last "}" should NOT have a "," after it). Type the name of the response in the single quotes     #
// # next to "Name:" and the text that you want to copy each time next to "Text:". Save the file when you  #
// # are done and close. Refresh the page after you save.                                                  #
// #                                                                                                       #
// # You need to type a "\n" (no quotes) any time that you want to put a new line in your copy text (just  #
// # like what happens when you press the "Enter" key while typing). You do NOT want to put a space before #
// # or after your "\n". You can see this done in the default options.                                     #
