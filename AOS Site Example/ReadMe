Only a quick note:

This site's links have all been removed as they are WalMart corporate links. The functionality for the other aspects have been left mostly unaltered. This site is exclusively used offline and is designed to replace Excel macros and to share bookmarks easily using links. The "Concatenate WINs" section is looking to take all 9 long numerical character sequences that are entered, even in large copied messages, and concatenate them with a delimiter of " OR " for use in our reporting. The "Concatenate Tickets" is designed to do the same, but with 5 digit sequences.
